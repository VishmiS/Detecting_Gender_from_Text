# Twitter User Gender Classification
This study investigates the procedures for determining the gender of an author on Twitter. We explore gender-related behavioral variations among Twitter users, leveraging the Twitter User Gender Classification dataset from Kaggle.

## Methodology
### Data Preparation:
We use the Twitter User Gender Classification dataset from Kaggle.

### Text Transformation:
Word embedding models and other techniques are employed to transform text into vectors. These include:
GLOVE
BERT
GPT-2
Word2Vec
Bag of Words (BOW)
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

### Machine Learning Analysis:
Various machine learning methods are analyzed to determine the most effective approach for gender classification. These methods include:
Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC)
Logistic Regression (LR)
Decision Tree (DT)
Random Forest (RF)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Objective
The primary goal is to identify the most effective machine learning approach for gender classification within the realm of Twitter.
